Pipex was the sixth project in the 42 School curriculum, serving as a fundamental stepping stone towards understanding more complex tasks such as building a custom shell. This project was designed to deepen my understanding of inter-process communication and Unix pipelines.

The Pipex project challenged me to replicate the behavior of the Unix shell command pipeline (|) using low-level system calls such as pipe(), fork(), and execve(). By mastering Pipex, I gained invaluable insights into process management, file descriptors, and command execution in the Unix environment.

This repository contained my implementation of the Pipex project, a testament to my dedication to mastering system programming concepts. As I delved into the intricacies of managing processes and redirecting input and output streams, I laid a solid foundation for tackling more advanced projects, such as building my own shell.

Embarking on a journey of discovery, I explored the inner workings of Unix pipelines and enhanced my programming prowess. With Pipex, I sharpened my skills and prepared myself for the challenges that lay ahead in the world of system programming and software development.
